# There are no stats to select from when price checking

If you don't see any stats, or only see basic item properties on
weapons/armour, then it means that the tool receives from the game
item text without any mods.

Make sure to check the [logs](/faq) first.
- Maybe you've bound an unsupported key for "Advanced Descriptions".
  For example, APT cannot press mouse buttons.
- Maybe you've non-ALT key bound for "Advanced Descriptions"
  but the PoE configuration file is in an unusual location.
- Maybe you won't find any clues there at all, simply because
  it's a key conflict with another running application on your PC.

Anyway, you need to make PoE copy the item with mods when the `Ctrl + Highlight + C`{:.whitespace-nowrap} is pressed.

What's a "Highlight" key? What should the mods look like in the copied text?\
You can see on the images from [related page](/nothing-happens).
